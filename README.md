# Cryptography
Here you can find some folders about projects in cryptography. In particular:

- **Classical_ciphers** contains some classical ciphers implemented in C (e.g. the vigenere cipher);
- **RSA** contains the standard RSA code in C for asymmetric cryptography;
- **Rijndael_sbox** contains the implementation of one of the buildin blocks to develop the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), in particular the Rijandael s-box.

Each folder has its own documentation file with more informations.
